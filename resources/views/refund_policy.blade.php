    <h3>Refund Eligibility</h3>

    <p>
        Our payment gateway services facilitate online transactions between customers and merchants. As a third-party payment
        gateway, we do not directly provide the products or services for which the payment was made. Therefore, refund requests
        should be directed to the respective merchant or service provider. Eligibility for refunds will be determined by the
        merchant's refund policy and applicable laws and regulations.
    </p>

    <h3>Merchant Refund Policy</h3>

    <p>
        Each merchant or service provider using our payment gateway has its own refund policy. It is the responsibility of the
        customer to review and understand the refund policy of the merchant before making a purchase or transaction. We are not
        responsible for any refunds or disputes between customers and merchants.
    </p>

    <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>

    <p>
        If you encounter any issues with a transaction or believe you are eligible for a refund according to the merchant's refund
        policy, we recommend the following steps:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Contact the merchant directly to discuss your refund request and provide any necessary documentation or evidence.</li>
        <li>If the issue remains unresolved, you may escalate the matter to our customer support team.</li>
        <li>Our customer support team will review the dispute and may facilitate communication between you and the merchant to
            help reach a resolution.</li>
        <li>Please note that we do not have the authority to issue refunds directly. Refunds are at the sole discretion of the
            merchant.</li>
    </ol>
